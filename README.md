$1 Gesture Recognizer in Java
======================
This is a Java port of the [$1 Unistroke Recognizer project](http://depts.washington.edu/madlab/proj/dollar/) at University of Washington/Microsoft Research: "a 2-D single-stroke recognizer designed for rapid prototyping of gesture-based user interfaces.". 

It was a quick port from the C# version to enable quick experiments on early touch-screen cell phones runing Java ME (Micro Edition), and later adapted for Android.
